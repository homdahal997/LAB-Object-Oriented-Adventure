# An Object-Oriented Adventure

### Part 1: Humble Beginnings

This part creates an `adventurer` object using object literal notation. The adventurer has properties like `name`, `health`, `inventory`, and `companion`. It also has a `roll` method that simulates rolling a 20-sided die (common in RPGs). The adventurer's inventory is logged to the console, a second companion is added, and the adventurer's details are logged.

### Part 2: Class Fantasy

This part introduces a `Character` class, which is used to create a new adventurer and companions. The `Character` class has a `roll` method similar to the one in Part 1.

### Part 3: Class Features

This part introduces two new classes, `Adventurer` and `Companion`, which extend the `Character` class. The `Adventurer` class has an additional `scout` method.

### Part 4: Class Uniforms

This part introduces static properties to the `Character` and `Adventurer` classes.
